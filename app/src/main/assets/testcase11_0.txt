There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. There once was a very
large lake here, the largest lake in Texas. That was over a
hundred years ago. Now it is just a dry, flat wasteland.
There used to be a town of Green Lake as well. The town
shriveled and dried up along with the lake, and the people
who lived there.
During the summer the daytime temperature hovers
around ninety-five degrees in the shade-if you can find any
shade. There's not much shade in a big dry lake.
The only trees are two old oaks on the castern edge of the
"lake." A hammock is stretched between the two trees, and
a log cabin stands behind that.
The campers are forbidden to lie in the hammock. It be-
longs to the Warden. The Warden owns the shade.
Out on the lake, rattlesnakes and scorpions find shade
under rocks and in the holes dug by the campers.
